# Comparative-Analysis-of-Apriori-and-FP-Growth-Algorithm-on-Retail-Store-dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that conducted a comparative analysis of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for association rule mining on a retail store dataset. The project aimed to assess the performance of these algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, scalability, and rule quality.

## Research Paper
The findings of this project are detailed in the research paper titled "Comparative Analysis of Apriori and FP-Growth Algorithms for Association Rule Mining in Retail Data,". The paper provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each algorithm and offers practical recommendations for algorithm selection based on dataset characteristics and mining objectives.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises transaction records from a retail store, with each record representing items purchased by customers. This dataset serves as the basis for evaluating the performance of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms.

# Algorithms
# Apriori:
Known for its iterative approach, the Apriori algorithm generates association rules by iteratively identifying frequent itemsets.
# FP-Growth: 
Utilizing a divide-and-conquer strategy with the FP-tree data structure, FP-Growth efficiently mines association rules by constructing a compact tree representation of the transaction database.
Evaluation
The evaluation of the algorithms includes measures such as runtime, memory usage, scalability, and rule quality. By rigorously comparing these metrics, we aim to provide practitioners with valuable insights into algorithm selection for association rule mining tasks in retail and similar domains.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted in this project, we offer practical recommendations for leveraging association rule mining effectively in retail and similar domains. These recommendations are tailored to assist decision-makers in optimizing their workflow and extracting actionable insights from transaction data.
